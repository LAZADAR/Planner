          Welcome to our portal! We're glad to see you here and hope that your
          time here will be enjoyable, useful, and productive. Wishing you
          success in all your endeavors. This planner is designed to help you
          visualize your tasks and interact with them conveniently. The planner
          does not store your data on the server, all data is saved on your

          need (by default, the current day is set), and then add tasks. Also,
          days with tasks are marked in blue to quickly find the desired day.
